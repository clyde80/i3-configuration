# Scripts
A collection of my bash scripts.

<p>
For older versions of scripts, checkout the files named "Scripts.i3conf.v#.zip" (located in the older_versions directory). 
There was a drastic change from i3conf.v11 to what will be i3conf.v12 (i3conf.v12 hasn't been created yet). i3conf.v# 
refers to the release tag. You can find the release tags on the releases page.
